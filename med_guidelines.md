# Patient Fall Management Guidelines

## Referral Decision Guide

Use this section to help determine which patients following a fall require referral to a medical facility and if so, to which type of facility. Use the 'syncope' section if the patient appears to have had a fall as a result of loss of consciousness.
Assess the patient, including an assessment of the features contained within the flag table. See the 'making recommendations using the flag tables' section.
In addition, perform a falls risk assessment if the patient is aged greater than or equal to 65 years, is living independently, and is not being transported to an ED by ambulance. Gain consent and refer the patient to a falls prevention service if any abnormalities are found. Alternatively, refer the patient to their GP if a falls referral pathway is not available.

### Red Flags
- Clinically significant injury
- Clinically significant pain
- Abnormal vital signs
- Signs of stroke
- Seizure without a history of epilepsy
- Headache
- New onset of visual disturbance
- Unable to mobilise
- Unstable medical condition contributing to the fall

### Orange Flags
- Should be seen in primary care within 24 hours
- More than one fall in the last week
- Postural hypotension
- Seizure with a history of epilepsy
- Recent change in medication
- Minor injury requiring non-urgent treatment
- New reduction in mobility but able to weight bear

### Green Flags
- Minor soft tissue injury not requiring medical treatment
- Able to mobilise in a manner that is normal for the patient

## General Principles
- A patient that has fallen without a clear mechanical cause requires a thorough history and clinical examination to rule out a cause for collapse.
- A patient that has fallen always requires an assessment to rule out injury, even if they appear to be uninjured.
- Do not use the term ‘lift assist’ when referring to a patient that has fallen.
- Falling is not a natural part of aging and all patients aged greater than or equal to 65 years who have fallen require an assessment that considers referral to a falls prevention service.
- Have a raised index for suspicion of injury if the patient:
  - Has fallen a significant height, for example greater than one metre or five stairs in an adult, or
  - Is taking an anticoagulant or has a known bleeding disorder.
- Always take into account the patient’s comorbidities and social circumstances.
- Examples of unstable medical conditions contributing to the fall include diabetes with poor glucose control and poorly controlled Parkinson’s disease. Clinical judgement is required when determining that a medical condition requires review in an ED or review by the patient’s GP.

## Clinical Judgement
- Clinical judgement must be used to determine when a patient with orange flags should be seen by a doctor. The 24 hour timeframe is a maximum and many patients should be seen sooner than this, for example if soft tissue injury is present.
- Postural hypotension is present if there is a fall of greater than 20 mmHg in the systolic BP or greater than 10 mmHg in the diastolic BP when standing.

## Falls Risk Assessment
- Falls are a common cause of injury and loss of independence in older patients.
- Ambulance personnel have an important role in referring older patients at risk of a fall to a falls referral pathway, as this reduces the risk of further falls and injury.
- Referral to a falls referral pathway is not required if the patient is living in an aged residential care facility because the facility personnel are required to manage this. Patients living in an independent unit (for example a villa) in the same complex as an aged residential care facility are designated as living independently.
Ask the patient the following questions:
- Have you slipped, tripped or fallen in the last year?
- Do you need to use your hands to get out of a chair?
- Are there any activities you’ve stopped doing because you are afraid of falling?
- Perform Romberg’s test.
- Perform a timed up and go test.
- Refer the patient to a falls referral pathway if:
- The patient answered ‘yes’ to any of the questions, or
- Romberg’s test is abnormal, or
- The timed up and go test is abnormal, or
- Personnel consider the patient is at risk of falling.
- Examine the environment for hazards which may contribute to the risk of falling. Examples include rugs, mats, cords and poor footwear. Eliminate these hazards with the patient’s permission if feasible.

### Assessment Questions
- Have you slipped, tripped or fallen in the last year?
- Do you need to use your hands to get out of a chair?
- Are there any activities you’ve stopped doing because you are afraid of falling?

### Tests
- Perform Romberg’s test.
- Perform a timed up and go test.

### Referral Criteria
Refer the patient to a falls referral pathway if:
- The patient answered ‘yes’ to any of the questions, or
- Romberg’s test is abnormal, or
- The timed up and go test is abnormal, or
- Personnel consider the patient is at risk of falling.

## Environmental Hazards
Examine the environment for hazards which may contribute to the risk of falling. Examples include rugs, mats, cords and poor footwear. Eliminate these hazards with the patient’s permission if feasible.

### Documentation

## General principles

* Documentation must be accurate and complete.
* Comprehensive documentation is particularly important when a patient is not transported to a medical facility.
* Documentation must be objective and subjective statements avoided. Take particular care to avoid subjective statements about the behaviour or demeanour of the patient, their family/whānau or other healthcare professionals.
* As a general rule, a third party (for example, The Health and Disability Commissioner) will assume that if something is not recorded it did not occur.
* A third party should be able to read the documentation and understand what happened and why.
* One person will usually lead the patient assessment and treatment and this person should usually complete the PRF. However, all clinical personnel in the crew are responsible for ensuring the documentation is accurate and complete.
* A separate PRF is required for each patient assessed. This includes for example, a separate PRF for a mother and her newborn baby.

## Patient Report Form (PRF) Requirements:

### Information to be Documented in the PRF

#### Patient Details
- Patient information (including NHI if possible)
- History and assessment of the patient

#### Treatment and Interventions
- Description of all significant treatment administered and/or interventions provided prior to ambulance arrival
- All treatment administered and interventions provided by ambulance personnel or by people assisting ambulance personnel

### Clinical Advice and Information
- Description of any clinical advice or information received

#### Vital Signs
- At least one set of vital signs (see the ‘vital signs’ section for more information)

#### Allergies and Medications
- Known allergies to medicines

#### Incident Information
- The PRF must contain all relevant information for the entire incident if the care and/or transport of the patient is transferred from one crew to another

### Documentation Guidelines
- The use of abbreviations should be minimised
- Terminology specific to ambulance personnel (for example R codes) must not be used

## Additional Requirements for Non-Transport Incidents

### Patient and Incident Details

## Checking the PRF before Finalisation and Submission

### Checking the PRF before it is Finalised and Submitted
- The PRF must be checked to ensure it is complete and accurate prior to it being finalised and submitted, unless the crew are required to immediately respond to an urgent incident.
- All clinical personnel in the crew that assessed the patient are responsible for ensuring the PRF is checked if the patient is not transported to a medical facility.
- All clinical personnel in the crew that transported the patient are responsible for ensuring the PRF is checked.

### PRF Check Requirements
The PRF check must include confirmation that:
- All appropriate sections have been completed.
- The information is accurate and free of errors.
- The information adequately reflects all that occurred, in a manner that ensures a third party could read the PRF and understand what happened.
- The discarding of controlled medicines that were drawn up but not administered is documented, including documentation that this has been witnessed by a second crew member whenever possible.
