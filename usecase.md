Use this section to help determine which patients following a fall require referral to a medical facility and if so, to which type of facility. Use the 'syncope' section if the patient appears to have had a fall as a result of loss of consciousness.

- Assess the patient, including an assessment of the features contained within the flag table. See the 'making recommendations using the flag tables' section.
- In addition, perform a falls risk assessment if the patient is aged greater than or equal to 65 years, is living independently, and is not being transported to an ED by ambulance. Gain consent and refer the patient to a falls prevention service if any abnormalities are found. Alternatively, refer the patient to their GP if a falls referral pathway is not available.

## Red flags

- Clinically significant injury.
- Clinically significant pain.
- Abnormal vital signs.
- Signs of stroke.
- Seizure without a history of epilepsy.
- Headache.
- New onset of visual disturbance.
- Unable to mobilise.
- Unstable medical condition contributing to the fall.

## Orange flags

Should be seen in primary care within 24 hours

- More than one fall in the last week.
- Postural hypotension.
- Seizure with a history of epilepsy.
- Recent change in medication.
- Minor injury requiring non-urgent treatment.
- New reduction in mobility but able to weight bear.

## Green flags

- Minor soft tissue injury not requiring medical treatment.
- Able to mobilise in a manner that is normal for the patient.

## Additional information

## General principles

- A patient that has fallen without a clear mechanical cause, for example a trip or slip, requires a thorough history and clinical examination to rule out a cause for collapse.
- A patient that has fallen always requires an assessment to rule out injury, even if they appear to be uninjured.
- Do not use the term 'lift assist' when referring to a patient that has fallen as this term should only be used when a crew is assisting another crew to lift a patient.
- Falling is not a natural part of aging and all patients aged greater than or equal to 65 years who have fallen require an assessment that considers referral to a falls prevention service.
- Have a raised index for suspicion of injury if the patient:
- Has fallen a significant height, for example greater than one metre or five stairs in an adult, or
- Is taking an anticoagulant or has a known bleeding disorder.
- Always take into account the patient's comorbidities and social circumstances.
- Examples of unstable medical conditions contributing to the fall include diabetes with poor glucose control and poorly controlled Parkinson's disease. Clinical judgement is required when determining that a medical condition requires review in an ED or review by the patient's GP.

- Clinical judgement must be used to determine when a patient with orange flags should be seen by a doctor. The 24 hour timeframe is a maximum and many patients should be seen sooner than this, for example if soft tissue injury is present.
- Postural hypotension is present if there is a fall of greater than 20 mmHg in the systolic BP or greater than 10 mmHg in the diastolic BP when standing.

## Falls risk assessment

- Falls are a common cause of injury and loss of independence in older patients.
- Ambulance personnel have an important role in referring older patients at risk of a fall to a falls referral pathway, as this reduces the risk of further falls and injury.
- Referral to a falls referral pathway is not required if the patient is living in an aged residential care facility because the facility personnel are required to manage this. Patients living in an independent unit (for example a villa) in the same complex as an aged residential care facility are designated as living independently.
- Ask the patient the following questions:
- Have you slipped, tripped or fallen in the last year?
- Do you need to use your hands to get out of a chair?
- Are there any activities you've stopped doing because you are afraid of falling?
- Perform Romberg's test.
- Perform a timed up and go test.
- Refer the patient to a falls referral pathway if:
- The patient answered 'yes' to any of the questions, or
- Romberg's test is abnormal, or
- The timed up and go test is abnormal, or
- Personnel consider the patient is at risk of falling.
- Examine the environment for hazards which may contribute to the risk of falling. Examples include rugs, mats, cords and poor footwear. Eliminate these hazards with the patient's permission if feasible.

## Romberg's test

- Stand beside the patient and be prepared to assist if they stumble.

- Ask the patient to stand with their feet together, place their arms by their side, get their balance and then close their eyes.
- Observe how long the patient can maintain the stance. A patient with normal balance should be able to maintain the stance without stumbling for more than 15 seconds.

## Timed up and go test

- Seat the patient in a chair and mark a location three metres away. The patient should wear their regular footwear and use any regular walking aids.
- Give the patient the following instructions. "When I say go I want you to stand up, walk to the line, turn around, walk back and sit down again".
- Begin timing on the word go and stop when the patient sits back down.
- The timed up and go test is abnormal if the time is longer than 12 seconds.
- During the timed up and go test observe the patient's posture, gait and balance. Record any obvious abnormalities.

## Referring the patient to a falls prevention service

- All DHBs in New Zealand have a falls prevention service offering follow up and support, which may include:
- Access to strength and balance programmes.
- The provision of mobility aids.
- Vision testing.
- Medication review.
- To refer a patient to a falls prevention service via ePRF, follow the instructions in the ePRF on local falls referral pathways.
- Include as much information in the ePRF as possible, enabling the falls prevention service to offer the patient the most appropriate support. For example:
- The patient's contact details, including their phone number.
- The answers to the falls risk questions.
- Whether the patient uses a mobility aid.
- Whether the patient requires assistance with their activities of daily living, for example showering.
- Whether the patient can leave their home unassisted.

- The results of Romberg's test and the timed up and go test.
