# UN Regulations 

## Do No Harm
Artificial intelligence systems should not be used in ways that cause or exacerbate harm, whether individual or collective, including harm to
social, cultural, economic, natural or political environments. All stages of an artificial intelligence system’s life cycle should operate in
accordance with the purposes, principles and commitments of the
Charter of the United Nations. All stages of an artificial intelligence
system’s life cycle should be designed, developed, deployed and
operated in ways that respect, protect and promote human rights and
fundamental freedoms. The intended and unintended impacts of
artificial intelligence systems, at any stage in their life cycle, should be
monitored in order to avoid causing or contributing to harm, including
violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms.

## Inclusion and participation

When designing, deploying and using artificial intelligence systems, United Nations system organizations should take an inclusive,
interdisciplinary and participatory approach, and promote gender
equality. They should conduct meaningful consultations with all
relevant stakeholders and affected communities as part of the processes of defining the purpose of an artificial intelligence system, identifying the assumptions underpinning its use, identifying the associated benefits, risks, harm and adverse impacts, and adopting prevention and mitigation measures.
